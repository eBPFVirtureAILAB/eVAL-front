This is a web application designed to help users learn eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) programming in their web browser. The application provides a seamless and interactive learning experience with the following features:

## Features

1. **Code Editor**: A dedicated input area where users can write and edit their eBPF code.
2. **Result Viewer**: A separate window to display the output or results of running the eBPF code.
3. **AI-Powered Guidance**: An AI assistant that can guide users based on their code input or the generated results, providing insights and suggestions.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: The AI assistant can compare its predicted results with the actual server-run results. If there's a discrepancy, the AI will undergo reinforcement learning to improve its understanding.
5. **Collaboration**: Users can share their output results with colleagues or peers for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## Getting Started
